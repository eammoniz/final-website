This website is a personal portfolio of my professional work "as an animator". I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build it.
Here, you can view my accomplishments as an animator in the field (with pretend roles and experiences listed), as well as
personal art created by me over the years. There are tabs to navigate between my professional life & history, which is a generally
organized resume, and an option to submit a form to contact me.
