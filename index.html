          <h2>~ Bringing Art to Life ~</h2>
          <p>Welcome to my portfolio as an artist and computer scientist!</p>
          <p>I studied computer science to pursue animation and visual arts software engineering. I have a strong 
            passion for the arts and traditional animated styles, including but not limited to character design, 
            motion and movement, and behavioral scoring.</p>
          <h3>~</h3>
          <p>I have a lot of experience with static art methods such as drawing and painting, but as I continue
            my path as a computer science student, I am practicing my digital art skills to prepare for software
            development and animation studio work.</p>

          <div class="bootstrap-scope">
            <div id="carousel-wrapper"></div>
          </div>
          <h3>~</h3>
          <p>I enjoy working with digital art in my space time because of how advanced painting softwares 
            have become. As someone pursuing animation, I find working with digital softwares can be transitional
            from a solid background in studio arts.</p>
          <p>I work often in the studio to create art by hand because I often find the body movement during
            art creation is helpful in fulfilling the piece.</p>
          <h1 class="subtitle">I welcome you to my art portfolio!</h1>
          <p>Please explore my works in the menu tabs above to see a taste 
            of my range and style. Feel free to contact me about past, current, or future works! I am always
            open to an art discussion.</p>

          <!-- about me, personal & interests -->
          <h3>~ Journey through College ~</h3>
          <p>Right out of high school, I attended the University of Arizona for about 3 years in what I thought
            was the path toward a computer engineering degree. I later discovered I had been put onto Electrical
            Engineering by mistake, and I fled Tucson about a year after COVID's first lockdown.</p>
          <p>Coming to Portland meant starting over, in some ways, and picking up where I left off in others.</p>
          <p>I moved in with my best friend and attended Portland State University for a couple years before 
            deciding to finish my lower division credits at Portland Community College. I finished my requirements,
            took a small detour to Berlin, Germany with the art department's travel abroad program, and have
            returned to PSU to complete my long journey for my Bachelor's degree in Science and/or Fine Arts. </p>
            <h3>~ Personal Interests ~</h3>
            <p>Drawing and painting are some of my favorite pasttimes, whether it be for a quick home DIY project 
            or a small sketch on the river. My roommate once brought me home a large sheet of plywood years ago, and 
            to this day I spend time painting on it and over it with new creative or seasonal concepts. </p>
            <p>I enjoy thrifting with my friends, spending time in the city, and dancing to latin and pop music. 
            When I get the chance, I love to be able to binge read inside; I can't deny I am a bit of a homebody.
            Although, I do enjoy speaking to new people about film, pop culture, and their hottest take.</p>

            As part of a typography class I took in Tucson, I restyled the alphabet using a through-line theme: Taylor Swift songs. Each letter was stylized

          <div class="caption">Digital Art made with Krita | 2800 X 4100 px & 350 dpi</div>
          <div class="description">
            The inspiration for this piece came from a short romantic novel written about two male lovers set in 1970s San Francisco. The 
            title was inspired by the Taylor Swift song from the album <i>Lover</i>, which helped set the color scheme of the work.

          <div class="caption">Digital Art made with Krita | 6000 X 7500 px & 500 dpi</div>
          <div class="description">
            This work was developed as a passion project to understand how to create ambiance and layered backgrounds with digital media.
            The somewhat monochromatic palette was a personal challenge to avoid using colors to texturize the piece or to indicate where objects are in space.
          </div>

          <div class="description">
            The prompt for this piece was to re-create a book cover, and my inspiration was Lang Leav's incredible poetry novel <i>Memories</i>.
            I connected to her poetry early on and have developed a personal collection of her work. I often use my copies as sketch books and use her poems as 
            drawing prompts.
