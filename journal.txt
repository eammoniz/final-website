Creating an HTML Professional Website Portfolio - Final Project Journal
Elizabeth Moniz | CS 463 | 9 December 2025

For this assignment, I wanted to incorporate my artistic side and highlight my career goals
as an animator. I wanted to have styles that were warm and decorum rather than 
corporate sleek, as I spend a lot of time at my day job aborbed in the blues and greys.

SOURCES NOTE: It is implied that the class resources were used throughout the building
of my website. This includes things like using the lab notebooks for image insertion, form
building, etc. 
Most of the sources I provided here are external, and these links are just the websites I had up and
copied and pasted here as references.

Shoutout to my Pinterest boards for providing all the photos used to style my website!

All of the artworks featured in the Home Carousel and Projects tab are created by me. 

WORKING THROUGH THE WEBSITE

- THE FRONT PAGE -
    - THE TITLE CARD -
    To build the front page, I was used several references to our early HTML days.
    This includes our first few projects in the lab notebook and resources from the 
    opening weeks.

    I started with the title and a body area to have tabs of information in the 
    assignment requirement. The title is a different font to the rest of the page
    to really sell a "title card" element moreso than text introducing the website.

    To add to the title card idea, I put an image as the background and have it repeat its 
    pattern to fit any screen dimension or zoom size. I enjoyed keeping my website to a 
    yellow & purple theme because I felt their complimentary nature was an artistic way to 
    spruce up the elements with color but preserving a sense of professionalism with tidiness. 

    - THE HOME PAGE -
    I wrote a small blurb to introduce myself and the contents of the site since it is the first
    page to load. 
    I also included a few photos to introduce my style to the viewer to preview my art. This was
    also an opportunity to install a carousel element with bootstrap!
    I have this all written in the .js file because I found having it in the shadow HTML prevented 
    it from taking over all my pre-written styles. I only used one for this project.

- THE MENU NAVIGATION BAR -
    NAVBAR
    In order for there to be pages on my website, I decided to use a navbar element to organize 
    subsections into navigational tabs that only appear when clicked on. This allows there to be
    separate pages that are accessible from the single HTML page, and it does not affect the 
    fancy title card or submenu when navigating between pages.

    I played with several styles before ultimately opting for round buttons on a plain background.
    I found using images as the menu background or button style was distracting and a bit tacky.

- THE OTHER TAB'S PAGES -
    ABOUT Page
    This page highlights my "work experience" (I'm manifesting) and some personal information.
    There is a table to hold information about my totally real work experience, followed by a 
    segment detailing my college experience. There is a small bit at the end that talks about
    my personal interests and hobbies outside of work.

    PREVIOUS WORK Page
    For this section, I basically copied information from my totally real resume and pasted them into
    stylized tables, formatted differently but with the same logic as the blurb in About.
    I decided to have a couple of flex boxes to list my skills and experience between both fields, computer
    science and studio art. 

    Info Note- these dates & projects are not accurate at all! I was 4 in 2004, not graduating
    high school! Though, I did need a fun way to incorporate the elements of the website with practical
    information. I had fun dreaming of a world I worked on Zootopia!

    PROJECTS Page
    This page contains a list of my projects over the years. THIS section is all real- every piece of art was
    done by me. All these projects are either personal works or assignments from college. 
    I highlighted these with a fun little border box that is similar to formal mounting paper, or a style galleries
    prefer to accentuate the art.
    The pieces in series have a more strict boundary set to fit them all in a line, and the rest have their own styles
    to simply be contained by the border boxes.

    CONTACT Page
    The contact page is a quick little form to have someone insert thier personal information and leave a message. It
    requires the site visitor to include their name, email, and a message to be sent. The phone number field is optional.
